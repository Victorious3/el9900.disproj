Eventual decomp of the SHARP EL-9900 GSII ROM

If you want to get access to the missing ROM please contact me.
It has been decrypted from the EL-9900 Simulator which is gone from the internet.
I will archive the Simulator at some point and publish the decryptor script but for now I want to avoid SHARP doing anything funky.
Technically the ROM (or at least most of its code) survives as part of the newer EL-9950 series so I don't want to risk anything.
